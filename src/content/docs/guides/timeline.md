description: A comprehensive overview of Tondi Chain's development roadmap, technological milestones, and strategic positioning within the broader blockchain ecosystem
---

The evolution of Tondi Chain represents a carefully orchestrated progression toward establishing a robust, privacy-focused blockchain infrastructure. This timeline reflects our commitment to building upon proven technologies while introducing innovative solutions that address the fundamental challenges facing modern blockchain systems.

### Current Infrastructure: Comprehensive Development and Testing Phase

The current phase of Tondi Chain development is characterized by intensive testing and refinement of core infrastructure components. Our development team has been conducting extensive testing of the Tondi node client, CLI tools, mining programs, listeners, scanners, and indexers. These foundational components form the backbone of the network's operational capabilities and are currently undergoing rigorous validation to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

The [Tondi Dashboard](https://dashboard.tondi.org/) serves as the primary interface for early adopters, featuring a simplified wallet module that provides essential functionality for network interaction. This interim solution enables users to create and manage wallets, generate addresses, view transaction histories, and perform basic send and receive operations. While this dashboard wallet fulfills immediate needs for network participants, it represents merely the foundation upon which our comprehensive ecosystem will be constructed.

Complementing the dashboard, the [Tondi Explorer](https://explorer.tondi.org/) provides comprehensive blockchain exploration capabilities, enabling users to investigate transaction histories, examine block details, track address activities, and analyze network statistics. This explorer serves as a critical tool for developers, researchers, and network participants who require detailed insights into blockchain operations and transaction flows.

The dashboard also provides real-time monitoring capabilities, offering visibility into critical network metrics including activity levels, transaction statistics, node distribution patterns, and mining difficulty adjustments. This transparency ensures that the community can observe and understand the network's operational dynamics during its formative stages.

### October 2025: Official Wallet Launch

The official Tondi wallet, scheduled for release in October 2025, will mark a significant milestone in the project's maturation. This full-featured application will incorporate enterprise-grade security measures, enhanced user experience design, and advanced functionality that positions it among the most sophisticated wallet solutions in the blockchain space.

The wallet's architecture will be built upon a foundation of cutting-edge cryptographic protocols, ensuring that users benefit from the latest advances in blockchain security and privacy technology. This development represents not merely a product launch, but rather the culmination of extensive research and development efforts aimed at creating a wallet solution that meets the demanding requirements of both individual users and institutional participants.

### November 2025: RGB Integration and Layer 2 Implementation

The integration of RGB (Really Good Bitcoin) protocol into the Tondi ecosystem, planned for November 2025, represents a strategic alignment with Bitcoin's evolving technological landscape. This implementation will establish Tondi as a Layer 2 solution that leverages RGB's proven privacy and scalability benefits while maintaining compatibility with Bitcoin's broader ecosystem.

The RGB integration will enable enhanced scalability through improved transaction throughput, while simultaneously providing superior privacy features through the protocol's sophisticated cryptographic mechanisms. This development positions Tondi at the forefront of Bitcoin-compatible Layer 2 solutions, offering users seamless interoperability with Bitcoin's RGB ecosystem while maintaining the unique advantages of the Tondi network architecture.

### December 2025: FUN20 Standard and Backend Infrastructure

The release of the FUN20 standard and accompanying backend client in December 2025 will establish a comprehensive token framework for the Tondi network. This standard represents a significant advancement in tokenization technology, providing developers and users with a robust, standardized approach to token creation, management, and interaction.

The FUN20 standard will facilitate interoperability with existing token ecosystems while introducing enhanced security and compliance features that address the evolving regulatory landscape. The accompanying backend client will provide developers with powerful APIs and development tools, enabling rapid deployment of token-based applications and services within the Tondi ecosystem.

### 2026: Advanced Wallet Features and Protocol Enhancements

The year 2026 will witness the introduction of sophisticated wallet features that leverage the latest advances in cryptographic research and blockchain technology. These enhancements will include **manual UTXO consolidation** capabilities, enabling users to optimize transaction fees and privacy through strategic management of their transaction outputs.

Full support for Bitcoin's **Taproot protocol** will be implemented, providing users with enhanced privacy and efficiency through the protocol's advanced cryptographic constructions. The wallet will also incorporate **Cross-Input Signature Aggregation (CISA)** and **MuSig** technologies, enabling more efficient transaction processing and enhanced security through multi-signature schemes.

Advanced privacy features, including CoinJoin implementations and other privacy-enhancing technologies, will be integrated to provide users with comprehensive privacy protection. Additionally, the wallet will support seamless integration with RGB smart contracts and FUN20 token interactions, creating a unified platform for complex blockchain operations.

### 2026: Open Source Initiative

The decision to open-source client and related tools in 2026 reflects our commitment to transparency, community-driven development, and the broader principles of decentralized technology. This strategic timing ensures that core technologies have achieved sufficient stability and security before being made available to the broader developer community.

The open-source initiative will be accompanied by comprehensive documentation, developer resources, and community support structures. This approach ensures that the transition to open-source development maintains the high standards of security and reliability that have characterized the project's development thus far, while simultaneously fostering innovation through community participation and collaboration.

This timeline represents not merely a series of product releases, but rather a comprehensive strategy for establishing Tondi Chain as a leading platform for privacy-focused blockchain applications, built upon proven technologies while incorporating innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of the blockchain ecosystem.
