---

Tondi is a reference project for next-generation PoW settlement chains, combining GHOSTDAG, P2TR, Blake3, and Schnorr batch signatures to redefine throughput and privacy standards.

## Core Architecture Components

| Module | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|
| **Consensus** | GHOSTDAG (parallel blocks + Blue Block weighting) |
| **Hashing** | Blake3, far superior to SHA256, SIMD support |
| **UTXO Model** | BTC-homomorphic, P2TR supported |
| **Signatures** | Schnorr batch signatures + parallel verification |
| **Block frequency** | Dynamic ≥10 blocks/sec, auto-adjust|
| **Transaction processing** | Parallel mempool ordering & validation, supports 10k+ TPS|

## Performance Characteristics

### Consensus Layer
- **GHOSTDAG Protocol**: Enables parallel block processing with Blue Block weighting
- **Dynamic Block Frequency**: ≥10 blocks per second with automatic adjustment
- **Parallel Validation**: Supports 10,000+ transactions per second

### Hashing & Security
- **Blake3 Algorithm**: Significantly superior to SHA256 with SIMD support
- **Schnorr Signatures**: Batch signature processing with parallel verification
- **UTXO Model**: Bitcoin-homomorphic structure with P2TR support

### Transaction Processing
- **Parallel Mempool**: Concurrent ordering and validation
- **High Throughput**: 10,000+ TPS capability
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second confirmation times

## Comparative Analysis

### Vs. Bitcoin (BTC)

**Advantages:**
- **Throughput**: Tens of times higher (7 TPS vs. 15,000–25,000 TPS)
- **Privacy**: Unified privacy structure, no path leakage
- **Anchoring**: Only commitments submitted, ideal for RGB & Taproot assets

**Investment Highlight**: Optimal L2 settlement platform for BTC-native assets

### Vs. Solana

**Advantages:**
- **No Account Model**: No global state sync, low hardware requirements
- **Confirmation Independence**: Independent of state scheduling, no GPU dependency
- **Decentralization**: Maintains PoW architecture

**Investment Highlight**: Solana alternative under decentralized PoW architecture

### Vs. ETH Rollups

**Advantages:**
- **No General-Purpose VM**: Focuses on state anchoring & throughput optimization
- **Independent Cost Structure**: Independent of ETH Gas costs
- **Client Execution Support**: Supports RGB / SBT / DAO client execution

**Investment Highlight**: Flexible anchoring base layer for high-frequency scenarios

## Technical Advantages

### Performance First Design
- **Minimal Script Support**: No general-purpose VM, only Taproot-compatible script paths
- **Covenant Primitives**: CTV, Vault, and other covenant-based security models
- **Client-Side Validation**: All channel and L2 protocol execution is wallet-side

### Hardware Efficiency
- **Resource Efficiency**: Superior to Solana in resource usage
- **Low Operating Threshold**: Extremely low hardware requirements
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Better privacy characteristics than existing solutions

### Scalability Solutions
- **Native Channel Support**: Built-in support for APO + Eltoo + Channel Factories
- **Signature Aggregation**: CISA reduces transaction size by 30–50%
- **Privacy Payments**: PTLC enhances privacy and conditional payment capability

## Architecture Benefits

### For Developers
- **Simplified Integration**: Easy integration with existing Bitcoin tooling
- **Performance Testing**: Real-world environment for testing Bitcoin proposals
- **Client-Side Focus**: Wallet-side execution reduces complexity

### For Enterprises
- **Compliance Ready**: FATF-compliant interfaces and selective disclosure
- **High Performance**: 15,000–25,000 TPS for high-frequency trading
- **Cost Effective**: Low fees and efficient resource usage

### For Users
- **Better UX**: Simplified channel updates and reduced arbitration needs
- **Privacy**: Enhanced privacy through PTLC and other privacy protocols
- **Reliability**: Fork-resistant finality in 1–2 seconds
