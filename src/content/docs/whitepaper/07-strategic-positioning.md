|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-----|--------|
| **Consensus** | GHOSTDAG (pruning+parallel) | GHOSTDAG | PoS+BFT | PoW (longest chain) | PoS / ZK |
| **State model** | Stateless (UTXO+commitments) | Stateless (pure UTXO) | Stateful (accounts) | Stateless | Stateful (sync required) |
| **Contract support** | Native FUN20 / RGB / Taproot L2 / channel factories | None | General VM | Minimal scripts | General VM |
| **Privacy** | Implicit (native RGB L2) | None | Low (account tracking) | None | Partial (e.g., Aztec) |
| **Compliance** | Privacy + selective disclosure | Low | Medium | High | Medium (ZK-dependent) |
| **TPS theoretical** | 15,000–25,000 | 1,000–3,000 | 65,000 | 7 | 1,000–4,000 |
| **Finality** | 1–2s, fork-resistant | 1–2s | 0.4–0.8s | 10m | sec–min |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Medium | High | Minimal but inefficient | High (proof dependent) |
| **Investment** | Very High | Medium | High | Saturated | High but concentrated |
