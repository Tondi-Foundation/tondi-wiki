title: "VIII. Copperfield Plan: Bitcoin's Proving Ground for Unadopted BIPs"
description: "Tondi as Bitcoin's experimental laboratory for testing unadopted BIP proposals"
---

## Vision

To further emphasize Tondi's role as a BTC Taproot-native experimental chain, Avato Labs introduced the **Copperfield Plan** â€” turning Tondi into a living experimental ground for BIP proposals not adopted or still debated.

### Dual Objectives

1. **Validation for Bitcoin**: Provide real-world environments for long-discussed proposals, generating reference data
2. **Preparation for the Next Era**: Explore if Bitcoin's "trilemma" (decentralization, security, scalability) can evolve dynamically, rather than stagnate in conservatism

### Core Philosophy

> We believe: inaction â‰  reduced risk. Conservatism protects today's Bitcoin, but experimentation prepares tomorrow's.

## Copperfield Focus Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Channel & Scalability Layer

- **ANYPREVOUT (TSP-0007)** â€“ Eltoo & simplified channel updates
- **Channel Factories (TSP-0012)** â€“ multi-party factories, reduced footprint
- **CTV (TSP-0009)** â€“ covenant-based commitments

### ðŸ”¹ Privacy & Signature Layer

- **PTLC (TSP-0010)** â€“ privacy-enhanced conditional payments
- **CISA (TSP-0008)** â€“ cross-input Schnorr aggregation
- **Native MuSig2 (TSP-0011)** â€“ efficient multisig, consensus-integrated

### ðŸ”¹ Performance & State Management

- **UTreeXO** â€“ stateless client, Merkleized UTXO
- **AssumeUTXO** â€“ fast node bootstraps via snapshot validation

### ðŸ”¹ Extension Models

- **Ark** â€“ UX-improved off-chain pools
- **Statechains** â€“ transferable off-chain custodianship

### ðŸ”¹ Covenant & Contract Layer

- **OP_VAULT** â€“ delegated spending vaults
- **OP_CAT** â€“ byte concatenation opcodes for covenant expressions
- **OP_CSFS** â€“ checksum script validation for advanced contracts

### ðŸ”¹ Applications & Standards

- **FUN20 (TSP-0006)** â€“ inscription-like fungible token standard

## Experimentation Process & Community Feedback

### Three-Phase Validation Cycle

```

#### 1. Frontier Phase
- **Rapid testnet implementation** & trials
- **Community testing** and feedback
- **Technical validation** of concepts

#### 2. Mainnet Phase
- **Mature features deployed**, run under load
- **Real-world performance** testing
- **Economic impact** assessment

#### 3. Reporting Phase
- **Technical reports** & real-world data
- **Performance metrics** and analysis
- **Recommendations** for Bitcoin Core & BIP authors

## Strategic Philosophy

### Bitcoin's Evolution

> Bitcoin's durability comes from conservatism, but progress comes from exploration.

Tondi's mission is not to compete with Bitcoin, but to serve as its **"wind tunnel laboratory"**:

### Core Principles

1. **Not weakening security**, but stress-testing attack surfaces & UX
2. **Not solving the trilemma**, but empirically testing decentralization/security/scalability trade-offs
3. **Not splitting Bitcoin's path**, but filling its conservative gaps via experimentation

### Benefits for Bitcoin Ecosystem

- **Real-world Testing**: Test Bitcoin proposals in live environment
- **Performance Data**: Generate actual performance metrics
- **Community Feedback**: Gather community input on proposals
- **Technical Validation**: Validate technical feasibility

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (2025)

- **Core TSPs**: Implement foundational TSPs
- **Community Building**: Build developer and user community

### Phase 2: Expansion (2026)
- **Advanced TSPs**: Implement complex proposals
- **Mainnet Integration**: Deploy successful features to mainnet
- **Ecosystem Development**: Expand ecosystem partnerships

### Phase 3: Maturation (2027+)
- **Bitcoin Integration**: Feed results back to Bitcoin Core
- **Standardization**: Help standardize successful proposals
- **Global Impact**: Influence Bitcoin's evolution globally

## Community Engagement

### Developer Community
- **Open Source Development**: All TSPs developed openly
