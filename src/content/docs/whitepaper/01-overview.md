---

Tondi is a next-generation high-performance transaction settlement and Layer 2 anchoring base chain jointly developed by Avato Labs and the Tondi Foundation. It inherits the DAG architecture of Kaspa (the world's fastest PoW chain), achieving breakthroughs in throughput, privacy protection, security, and compliance.

## Core Definition

Tondi is defined as a **"High-Performance PoW Programmable Settlement Layer"**, designed specifically for:

- High-frequency trading
- Stablecoin settlement  
- Compliant privacy payments
- Off-chain state anchoring and channel extensions in core Web3 scenarios

## Architectural Innovation

It is not an extension of BTC or Kaspa solutions, but a **brand-new architecture**: built on a high-speed PoW DAG base layer, combined with Eltoo, Channel Factories, CISA, PTLC, and APO, forming a next-generation scalable settlement paradigm for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Key Capabilities

Tondi is not only a high-performance base layer chain but also the ideal hosting platform for the maturation of the RGB protocol, natively supporting BTC Taproot-based Layer 2 contract structures. It is the first protocol fully compatible with the BTC Taproot ecosystem, significantly surpassing its performance and privacy limitations.

## Strategic Position

Tondi serves as both:
- A **high-performance base layer chain** for settlement
- An **ideal hosting platform** for RGB protocol maturation
- The **first protocol** fully compatible with the BTC Taproot ecosystem

This positions Tondi as a bridge between Bitcoin's security and the performance demands of modern financial applications.
